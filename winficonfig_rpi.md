If you're setting up Wi-Fi credentials on a **Raspberry Pi** for the first time before it even boots, you can configure it directly on the SD card you're going to use to flash the Raspberry Pi OS. This way, your Raspberry Pi will connect to the Wi-Fi network automatically when it first boots up, without needing to interact with the terminal.

Here’s how you can set it up:

### 1. Flash Raspberry Pi OS onto the SD Card
- Download and flash Raspberry Pi OS (or Raspberry Pi OS Lite) onto your SD card using **Raspberry Pi Imager** or **Balena Etcher**.

### 2. Access the SD Card on Your Computer
- After flashing, remove and reinsert the SD card into your computer. You should see a partition named **boot** or something similar.

### 3. Create/Modify the `wpa_supplicant.conf` File
- In the **boot** partition (the root directory of the SD card), create a new file called `wpa_supplicant.conf`. You can do this using any text editor.

For example, you can use Notepad on Windows or TextEdit on macOS.

- Inside the `wpa_supplicant.conf` file, add your Wi-Fi network credentials:

```plaintext
country=IN  # Set your country code, e.g., US for the United States, GB for Great Britain, etc.

ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1

network={
    ssid="YourWiFiNetwork1"
    psk="YourWiFiPassword1"
}

network={
    ssid="YourWiFiNetwork2"
    psk="YourWiFiPassword2"
}
```

- Make sure to replace `"YourWiFiNetwork1"` and `"YourWiFiPassword1"` with your actual Wi-Fi network's SSID and password. You can add more `network` blocks as needed for multiple networks.
- Save the file as `wpa_supplicant.conf` (make sure the extension is `.conf`).

### 4. Enable SSH (Optional)
If you want to enable SSH for remote access on first boot, you can create an empty file called **`ssh`** (without any extension) in the **boot** partition. The Raspberry Pi will automatically enable SSH if it sees this file on the SD card.

### 5. Eject the SD Card
- Safely eject the SD card from your computer.

### 6. Insert the SD Card into Your Raspberry Pi
- Place the SD card into your Raspberry Pi and power it on.

### 7. First Boot
- On the first boot, the Raspberry Pi will automatically connect to the Wi-Fi networks specified in the `wpa_supplicant.conf` file. If it can’t find the first network, it will try the next one.
- If you've enabled SSH, you can now log in remotely to your Pi (using `ssh pi@<raspberry-pi-ip>`), and the default password is `raspberry`.

### Troubleshooting:
- If the Pi doesn’t connect, you can check the Pi's boot logs for errors. You can access them via SSH or check the SD card on another system to review logs.

This method ensures your Raspberry Pi will connect to Wi-Fi automatically on the first boot without needing any terminal interaction.
